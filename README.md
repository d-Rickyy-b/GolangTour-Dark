# GolangTour-Dark
A dark theme for the "Tour of Go" introduction for the Go programming language

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This dark theme is no longer maintained since "Tour of Go" now has an official dark theme you can enable at the top right of the page.

### Showcase
Here is a picture to get an idea of how the style will look like.

### Usage
To use this style, you need a browser plugin such as [Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/). It injects custom CSS code into specified webpages.

Now either copy & paste the content of the [golangtour-dark.user.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d-Rickyy-b/GolangTour-Dark/main/golangtour-dark.user.css) into the plugin you are using.

Or ðŸ“¦ [install the usercss](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d-Rickyy-b/GolangTour-Dark/main/golangtour-dark.user.css) automatically. Also supports automatic future updates.

### Found an issue
If you think you found an issue with the style (and I bet there are plenty), go ahead and open an issue in the GitHub issue tracker.
Thanks for your support.
